    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am someone who loves watching series, going to the gym, and walking. I
      work as a UI/UX designer, and if you're reading this, it means you're
      witnessing my first steps toward becoming a full-stack web developer. In
      this fast-paced world of technology, I am always eager to learn and
      discover new skills. I strive to improve myself every day, as I believe
      that the key to success in todayâ€™s world is a commitment to continuous
      learning and an openness to new ideas. Watching series allows me to
      explore different worlds and narratives, while my time at the gym helps
      enhance both my physical and mental well-being. Additionally, my walks
      serve as a perfect way to disconnect from the daily stress and gather my
      thoughts. The challenges I encounter along this journey are valuable
      opportunities for growth. I am determined to achieve my goals and am ready
      to learn something new every single day.
